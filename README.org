* Linear.el
** Overview
Linear.el is still a major WIP. This is a magit-style interface for interacting with [[https://linear.app/][Linear App]].
** Installation
TODO

** Setup
- Create a LinearAPI key and set it to an env variable (for now)
- Ensure you can access it with =(getenv "WHAT_YOU_NAMED_KEY")=
- Run =linear-status= to kick off the initial screen which will list all /active/ projects within your workspace
